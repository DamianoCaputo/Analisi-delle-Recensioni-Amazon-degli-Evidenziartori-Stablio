3.0 out of 5 stars,Depends on the paper...,Verified Purchase,"So I saw these highlighters and I was like God damn, gotta get me some of those (how sad, I treat myself with highlighters for work). I didn't read reviews  I thought they were a good brand and therfore my order was placed and I was going to receive these gorgeous pastel highlighters! Anyway, they turned up fast as I have prime and they are cute. The good thing is that these aren't going to run out on you anytime soon, they are very wet and glide along the paper nicely. The only problem is that they are anti dry out ones so they are always wet and you can leave the lids off, this means when you use them there is a lot of ink coming out, and I mean a lot. This also means that if you are using crappy thin paper that it's just going to go straight through to the other side. I have attached photos to show them on thick paper (nice and neat) and on the paper I use to print on and it's a bit patchy. I have also attached a photo of the back of paper which shows them going though to the other side. Once it dries out it leaves my pages a bit bumpy from where it has expanded with the liquid. Moral of the story, don't impulse buy cute things (I am a female and will never learn this lesson) and make sure you read reviews. Other than that quite a decent set, but for the price, maybe I will settle for Poundland ones next time...",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Motivating Highlighters!,Verified Purchase,"Ahhh! These highlighters made me WANT to study just so I could see the pretty colours! All I can say is: BEWARE because your friends WILL try and nick them from you! Unlike typical fluorescent highlighters, these are not harsh on the eyes and can make all notes - no matter how scruffy - look presentable and that you put time and effort into them.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 May 2017
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best highlighters on the market,Verified Purchase,"These are the best highlighters on the market!They have a good range of colours, which is great for me as I like to colour code my work and revision notes. They last absolutely ages before running out! Honestly you can't get a better selection of highlighters than these so don't bother looking elsewhere!Please click on the “Yes” button below if this review has been helpful thank you",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2017
4.0 out of 5 stars,The pastels are so much nicer than the original colours!,Verified Purchase,"If you’ve ever used Stabilo highlighters then these are the quality you’d expect but in better colours. Unlike the standard/original pack, these are less harsh on the eyes and make notes look so colourful.My only complaint is that at the time of purchasing these, they were only available as an ‘Add on’ item. I tried searching Amazon/other shops but couldn’t find the pastels for sale on their own. Luckily, I had a few things on my wish list but this would have been so frustrating otherwise.Also, something that’s very minor is that the yellow is more of a bright yellow rather than a pastel; so that could be something for them to work on.Other than that, the highlighters are high quality (as you’d expect) and I’ll definitely be purchasing them again once mine have ran out.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 August 2018
1.0 out of 5 stars,AVOID - not as described,Verified Purchase,"Avoid!! these were no where near as described.  I received 1 purple, 1 pink, 1 orang and 1 blue . .  They are not pastel! They just came loose in a grey posting bag, not in the packaging that was shown in the picture.writing has rubbed off them from handling.  they feel very very light but i haven't got any other stabilo highlighters to compare to",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Dupes for Mildliners,Verified Purchase,"If you've used Stabilo's before the you know what you're getting. These are really good colours and great dupes if you aren't able to get your hands on some of the ever popular Zebra Mildliners and incredibly useful for anyone who finds neons a bit too hard on the eye. They do have some slight ghosting at the end of the line in certain notebooks, as ink is more saturated in that area, but otherwise they work great. I was slightly miffed to see that other high street stores are currently having back to school sales and are offering better prices for the this, the 6 and 8 pack but I'll survive.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2017

5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars :),Verified Purchase,"high quality product, everything in perfect condition. Had these highlighters for months and they still work perfectly; not dry at all.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2016
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just the right amount of bright,Verified Purchase,"I have had a tricky relationship with highlighters over my long history of studying. I like to highlight key words, equations, and important considerations, however typical highlighters are so bright and attention grabbing that I struggle to focus on the rest of the text. It is only now that I'm studying my masters I finally came across the solution to my problem, which is in the form of this pastel set. They are bright enough to highlight important parts of your notes, but not so bright that they drag your eyes away from what you're reading.In terms of quality; it's Stabilo Boss, they're a well established brand, and somewhat of a standard for highlighters, so you're not likely to get sent dry/depleted highlighters. You're more than likely going to lose these before they run out.If you feel a similar way about highlighters as I do then don't hesitate to buy these, they're a good product that is good enough to make me feel the need to come back months after I bought them to write a nice review for them. I don't do that often.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really pretty colours,Verified Purchase,"These pastel highlighters are so so pretty - I just want to highlight everything with them! They are much softer than the traditional neon ones and are great for making notes look more pleasing to the eye. They also tend to bleed through the paper a lot less than normal highlighters, so are really useful when highlighting in a book/on thin paper. One note regarding the colours: the blue is more of a turqoise than a baby blue (it's my favourite!) and the yellow is slightly darker than I expected, but it's not a negative. I would really encourage you to buy these so that you too can make your notes and documents beautiful!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Old faithful,Verified Purchase,"I bought these highlighters as an add on purchase which made for a great price. I love stabilo highlighters and have used them for around 30 years now (surely not!?).  I find them easy to hold and especially like the fact they are so easy to quickly cap and uncap the lids. We have free highlighters at work, which are a different brand,  I don't use them as the caps are very stiff. Stabilo is the choice for me every time - i would never buy another brand as they are so reliable. I use this set of 4 pens every day at work and they have lasted well over a year. Would always recommend this brand and as an add on item, I couldn't  beat Amazon for the price. These state they have new ""anti-dry-out"" technology so it will be interesting to see if these are different in any way from my old set.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Genuine Stabilo Boss highlighters that last much much longer than the cheaper brands.,Verified Purchase,I run an small/medium sized business with >25 engineers who go through a lot of highlighters marking up drawings. I've tried buying cheaper (non-Stabilo) ones before and they dry out too and don't last anywhere near as long as the genuine Stabilo ones or the nibs fall apart after just a few days.I would normally buy the single colour bulk boxes but these assorted colour sets actually worked out significantly cheaper so I bought a bulk of these instead.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2017
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great especially as they are so cheap!,Verified Purchase,"In the event that you've at any point utilized Stabilo highlighters, at that point these are the quality you'd expect yet in better hues. In contrast to the norm/unique pack, these are less unforgiving on the eyes and make notes look so brilliant.My lone protest is that at the hour of buying these, they were just accessible as an 'Extra' thing. I had a go at looking through Amazon/different shops however couldn't discover the pastels available to be purchased all alone. Fortunately, I had a couple of things on my list of things to get yet this would have been so baffling something else.Additionally, something that is extremely minor is that the yellow is to a greater degree a splendid yellow instead of a pastel; so that could be something for them to chip away at. Other than that, the highlighters are high calibre (as you'd expect) and I'll certainly be buying them again once the mine has run out.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good highlighters,Verified Purchase,"I bought these highlighter set because Stabilo highlighters have been really good based on my past experience. And when I saw that they do pastel colours I wanted to give it a try. Its essentially their original colours but lighter. I like it. I haven't used it a lot. Its not as straining for the eyes to read the highlighted sentences with these lighter colours rather than some of the other original darker colours. And its a nice change. I would still use their original colours too!Update September 2020:I've been using these highlighters for 1 year 3 months. The colours are lovely, light and very pleasing to the eye. Definitely pastel colours. I am very happy with it.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 June 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great colours for use as highlighters or for journaling or ...,Verified Purchase,"Great colours for use as highlighters or for journaling or more general art and crafts. As highlighters, I like these as the colours are softer on they eye  than the original colours. Haven't owned them for very long so can't comment on how well they will last, but very pleased with them at present.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better colours than the standard bright yellow etc...,Verified Purchase,"My daughter is about to take her GCSE's so we've got through a fair amount of highlighters over the last few months! She likes these because the colours are alternatives to the standard vivid highlighter colours and give greater choice of use.Great value too - at the time of ordering, these were the best price.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2019
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not good, would not recommend.",Verified Purchase,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I bought these highlighters on the understanding they would be genuine Stabilo. I compared these 4 highlighters with a 100% genuine one and these have different logo colour, different font and no barcode or info on the reverse. Furthermore, the plastic feels cheap. All these signs ring alarm bells that these are not original Stabilo. Very disappointed.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect!,Verified Purchase,"I absolutely love the colours of these. They are perfect and they dry quickly. They hardly bleed through pages and are soft enough colours to be very pretty but not super bold like the standard neon type you buy. The tips are great and apply evenly, and the ink doesn’t dry out.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2017
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,Verified Purchase,Absolutely amazing. I always use these highlighters for my notes as they make them look stunning and instantly make long boring pieces of text easier and more pleasant to look at. I've now found myself using any excuse to use them and I will definitely be reordering when they run out.The only negative is that the yellow is a bit darker than I expected but when used in combination with the other colours it doesn't look as dark as it does on its own.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 September 2017
5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Colours!,Verified Purchase,"I bought these as I needed different colours to analyse some university research. These came promptly, all beautiful colours. I am very pleased with my purchase. Stabilo highlighters do tend to be high quality, and this remains to be the truth.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2017
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lasts Well! Bleed Though Not Great, However...",Verified Purchase,"Bought this set a year and a half ago, and they've lasted so well. Beautiful colours. However they ink bleeds through more than I would like, on normal 70/80gsm paper and sometimes even bullet journal paper that absorbs more ink. Even when applying a light highlight without going over twice, when I flip the double-sided sheet over you can see the colours. If i need to go over it again to highlight bits I missed, any parts that get a double application of ink basically bleed through to the other side. Disappointing when using for work of study, and I'll actually sometimes just use felt tips (like Crayola Supertips)! Hope Stabilo can work on that.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2020
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely colours, good value for money, but just be aware of potential bleed-through!",Verified Purchase,"I have been using these for a couple of days and they are a fantastic range of colours, not too harsh on the eyes which I disliked about the original range, good value for money for the price I bought them.I must say that the ink does tend to bleed through to the other side of the page at the start and end of each stroke, and you can see where the colour has been applied on the other side. This happens even with a light touch, which isn't something I encountered too much with the original colours.  (As I am working through a copious amount of printed notes, I don't think to heavily about the pressure I use, and so with my usual grip there is a fair amount of bleed through). This doesn't bother me too much as I print on one side of the page to annotate the blank side, but I can imagine it would be irritating if there was print on both sides of the page.NB The paper I am using is 80gsm printer paper  - which I think is fairly standard- but I imagine with glossy textbook pages/ journal paper you wouldn't encounter this issue.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Felt tip markers,Verified Purchase,"I use a range of colours for my work but green and blue are the most frequent so great to be able to choose a single colour.  Have used these for years and always perform and last well.  My local stationers have brought in cheaper markers and stopped doing Stabilo hence my reluctant but successful internet purchase.  You just can't substitute quality.Great service, packaging and delivery.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 June 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these highlighters,Verified Purchase,"I love a good highlighter, and Stabilo is obviously one of the most well-known and trusted brands, and that's for good reason. I've never had a problem with their highlighters when using them for general study notes. I particularly like this range of colours as I'd been using the pastel range for quite a while so it was nice to have some vibrancy, and these are very bright! They last me quite well for what I use them for and I would say the price is reasonable given all of this",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good highlighters,Verified Purchase,"I’ve used Stabilo highlighters for many years and have been impressed by their reliability and longevity. I love the pastel colours of these ones and they were a good price, looking exactly as displayed on the website. The softer colours can help with making distinctions with the regular highligher colours. They are a good size and easy to hold and do not smudge easily. I’m very happy with this purchase",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2020
4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice light colours,Verified Purchase,"Overall:  highlighters are highlighters nothing more nothing less. However, I do love the new colours they are much more practical as they are lighter in colour than the old ones, for that reason I will be buying again.Longevity: I cannot answer this as I have not had them that long to answer, they are still doing what I bought them to do therefore, so far so good.Presentation: What can I say, they came in a packet?",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2019
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, a great product",Verified Purchase,"Whilst the range of colours is limited and some of the shades are very similar, meaning that it may be difficult to differentiate between two of the shades of pink at a quick glance so you couldn't really use them both when using multiple colours to represent different things; I do love the vibrancy and pigmentation of the pens and they are really good quality highlighters which I would definitely recommend to students (these were extremely useful to me when revising for my exams) and the value for money is really good.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 July 2017
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great range of colours!,Verified Purchase,"Great bright colours!I've used Stabilo highlighters plenty of times over the years and they never disappoint!

5.0 out of 5 stars,They last for ages!,Verified Purchase,"These are brilliant highlighters - the best brand, far better than any 'cheaper' rivals.  I cannot remember when I bought my last set like this - it's years and while I may not be a really regular user, they come out for certain jobs and though I've had them years they have never dried up.  They have just come to the end of their life!  I think also, I paid about the same price years on.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2019

The blue is a bit more ""turquoise"" colour which you can't really see in the photo (but is easily distinguished from the green) rather than a 'baby blue'.Very happy with these for my exam revision notes.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Pastel Colours,Verified Purchase,"These highlighters are great if you're looking for something a little less glaring than your average highlighter colour.

I can also confirm that they wash out of clothing really well too, after she decided to colour test the highlighters on her white leggings!!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just beautiful!,TOP 500 REVIEWER|Verified Purchase,These highlighters are so pretty and the subtlety of the pastel colours is so appeasing. My daughter and son love them.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"So nice, people steal them",Verified Purchase,"I purchased these when they were on offer. They are lovely - so much nicer than the fluorescent ones that look like you will be able to see them from space. However, there is a problem - they are so nice people keep stealing them! This makes it hard to comment on longevity as they were all pinched by colleagues before I could get them to run out!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2020

Plus they don’t appear visible on the back of the page when highlighted. So it’s exactly what we need. The only minus is that the yellow highlighter is a bit too bright to put into the pastel collection. But otherwise , the rest of the 5 highlighters were perfect.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Stabilo quality and a good price for a set of four,Verified Purchase,"I almost exclusively use yellow and green highlighters, and I was pleased to be able to buy four of the same colour, cheaper than buying 4 individual pens, and withut needing to buy a large set of assorted colours most of which I would never use.I bought a pack of four yellow, and a pack of four green.Stabilo are a well known brand and there was no surprise with the quality.  I have not tested how long I can leave the cap off without the pen drying out,  but I have not found a particular problem when using one for an extended time eg while marking up a large document.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2018
5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful colours!,Verified Purchase,"I have been using these highlighters for a year and a half and they're still going strong so they do last. They look beautiful and I prefer them to normal highlighters as they dont interfere with the writing at all. The only issues I have is some are wetter than others, more ink comes out particularly in the blue/turquoise one but it doesnt effect notes just takes longer to dry. Additionally, the orange and pink colours are sometimes harder to tell apart when quickly skimming through notes.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Delicate highlights that don't take over your notes,Verified Purchase,"I first got these highlighters when I was completing my master degree. I really dislike strong, neon colors in my notes. It's just too much of ""clown fiesta"" for me ;) These highlighters are perfect for someone like me - delicate colors, still highlighting whats the most important without taking over your entire notes. They last ages, still going on after completing master and 2 years of work ;)",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2020

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great pastel colours,Verified Purchase,"Lovely pastel colours that are not “in your face”. I found that highlighting was less likely to soak through the pages than with the brighter colours. It also may sound odd, but the fact that these colours were muted/pastel reduced study anxiety slightly; so much nicer to see pale pink highlight on a page rather than neon pink screaming at you haha!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2019
4.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant.,Verified Purchase,"The colours are absolutely gorgeous, and they last a very long time. The only things don’t like, is that they’re very big and for me, awkward to hold at times. Their size means that my pencil case is quite full, not leaving much room for anything else. The smaller versions of these would be more convenient, but would probably hold less ink, and are for some reason more expensive. My next purchase of pastel highlighters will be the smaller ones, but if you prefer large highlighters, these are the best.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really Reccomend,Verified Purchase,"Really nice pastel colours.

5.0 out of 5 stars,They’re so smooooth!,Verified Purchase,"Amazing. Arrived on time. Used it to highlight research papers during my revision. The yellow one I find is the best as it’s the most bright. Maybe they should make only yellows in a pack? But, even when you highlight with the other colours, you can still see the words underneath because the colours are pastel and light.

In this sense the wallet is good value for money.Finally, it is worth stating all the colours included are non obtrusive and will not make the original piece difficult to read.

They don't go hard or dry after a while like other cheap highlighters and don't fade either. The range of colours is fantastic and they are perfect for studying or notes.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 May 2013
